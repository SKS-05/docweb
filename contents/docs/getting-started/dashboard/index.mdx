# Dashboard

The Dashboard page is a central hub for managing the most essential aspects of your Seribro. It contains all the new entry buttons across the workspace multiple linked databases and views, providing quick access to habits, notes, tasks, projects, and other important information.

# Page Structure

## Buttons

The 16 buttons placed in 4 columns can be used to create a new entry in almost every database in Seribro.

<Note>
Remember: In order to use the start and end buttons for time tracking you need to create sessions (sub-items) using the toggle button next to the title. If you'd rather not use time tracking at all, I recommend replacing the time estimate, buttons and deviation property with properties more relevant to you.

<Note>
Make sure that you process all newly created entries by visiting all the feature pages regularly and going through their inboxes. Staying only on the dashboard is not advisable. Alternately, you can assign values to all important properties when creating new entries but this may cause friction with your experience using Seribro.
