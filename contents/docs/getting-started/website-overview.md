# Website Overview & Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

Areadocs is a modern documentation platform built with Next.js. It features:
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Password management (send, resend, and track email status)
- Algolia-powered instant search
- MDX-based content for easy documentation writing
- Responsive, accessible UI

---

## How the Website Functions

### 1. User Authentication
- Users log in with their email and password.
- Admin users (e.g., `sinchks94@gmail.com`) have access to special routes like `/send-passwords`.

### 2. Password Management
- Admins can upload a CSV of user emails.
- The system generates and sends temporary passwords to new users.
- Email status is tracked and displayed:
  - **New**: User just added, not yet sent a password.
  - **Processing**: Email is being sent.
  - **Email Sent**: Successfully sent.
  - **Already Sent**: Email was already sent previously.
  - **Failed to Send**: Sending failed (e.g., invalid email, bounce).

### 3. Resending Passwords
- Admins can select users with failed or already sent statuses and resend emails.
- Only users with "new" status are processed when "Generate & Send Passwords" is clicked.

### 4. Algolia Search

- The search bar uses Algolia DocSearch for instant, hierarchical search.
- Search results are grouped by main topic and subtopic.
- Clicking a result navigates to the correct documentation page.
- The search functionality is implemented using the `AlgoliaSearch` component (`components/algolia-search.tsx`), which is integrated into the navbar (`components/navbar.tsx`).
- Algolia is configured using the following environment variables in the `.env.local` file:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APP_ID`: Your Algolia Application ID.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME`: The name of your Algolia index configured to crawl your documentation content.
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY`: Your Algolia Search-only API Key.
- The indexing of documentation content is typically handled by the Algolia DocSearch scraper or a custom build process based on your Algolia configuration, which ensures all relevant files in `contents/docs/` are indexed.

### 5. Documentation Content
- All docs are written in MDX files under `contents/docs/`.
- Each page can have headings, code blocks, tables, and custom components.

### 6. Changing Admin Access
To change the admin email, follow these steps:

1. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Open `.env.local` file
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL` to the new admin email
   - Example: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL=sinchks94@gmail.com`

2. **Update Code Files**
   - Update admin email in `app/login/page.tsx`
   - Update admin email in `app/page.tsx`
   - Update admin email in `app/send-passwords/page.tsx`
   - Update admin email in `lib/email.ts`
   - Update admin email in `components/navbar.tsx`

3. **Update Database**
   - Run the update admin script: `node scripts/update-admin.js`
   - This will update the admin credentials in the database

4. **Verify Changes**
   - Log out of the current admin account
   - Log in with the new admin email
   - Verify access to admin features:
     - "Send Passwords" button in navbar
     - Access to `/send-passwords` page
     - Ability to send/resend passwords

---

## Key Features

- **Status Tracking:** Real-time email status for each user.
- **Bulk Operations:** Upload users via CSV, bulk send/resend passwords.
- **Search:** Fast, typo-tolerant, and grouped search results.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile.
- **Admin Controls:** Only admins can access sensitive routes.

---

## Possible Errors & How to Fix Them

### Authentication Errors
- **Wrong password:** User sees an error message. _Fix:_ Double-check credentials.
- **Not logged in:** Redirected to login page for protected routes. _Fix:_ Log in again.

### Email Sending Errors
- **Invalid email format:** Status set to "Failed to Send". _Fix:_ Check and correct the email address.
- **Email already sent:** Status set to "Already Sent". _Fix:_ Use the resend feature if needed.
- **SMTP/server error:** Status set to "Failed to Send". _Fix:_ Check SMTP credentials and server status.
- **Bounce detected:** Status set to "Failed to Send" after bounce check. _Fix:_ Verify the recipient's email address is valid and active.

### Admin Change Errors
- **"Not authenticated or not admin" error:**
  - _Fix:_ Ensure all files have been updated with the new admin email
  - _Fix:_ Clear browser cache and local storage
  - _Fix:_ Restart the Next.js development server

- **Missing "Send Passwords" button:**
  - _Fix:_ Check if `components/navbar.tsx` has the correct admin email
  - _Fix:_ Verify you're on the home page (`pathname === '/'`)
  - _Fix:_ Ensure you're logged in with the new admin email

- **Cannot access `/send-passwords` page:**
  - _Fix:_ Check if `app/send-passwords/page.tsx` has the correct admin email
  - _Fix:_ Verify the database update script ran successfully
  - _Fix:_ Check browser console for any authentication errors

- **Email sending fails after admin change:**
  - _Fix:_ Verify `lib/email.ts` has the correct admin email and app password
  - _Fix:_ Check SMTP configuration in the email service
  - _Fix:_ Ensure the new admin email has proper Gmail app password set up

### Algolia Search Errors
- **appId/apiKey/indexName missing:**
  - _Fix:_ Check your `.env.local` file and make sure all three are set.
- **No results:**
  - _Fix:_ Make sure your Algolia index has records with the correct structure.
- **404 on search result click:**
  - _Fix:_ The `url` in your Algolia record does not match a real page in your app. Update the record or create the page.
- **TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'lvl0'):**
  - _Fix:_ Ensure each Algolia record has a `hierarchy` object with at least `lvl0`.

### General UI Issues
- **Status flicker:**
  - _Fix:_ Only update statuses for users being processed. Do not clear all statuses at once.
- **Processing tag disappears too soon:**
  - _Fix:_ Don't clear the status before the email is actually sent.

## How to Add Documentation

- Add new `.mdx` or `.md` files under `contents/docs/` for each topic.
- Use headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) for hierarchy.
- Add code blocks, tables, and custom components as needed.

### Example: Adding a New Doc Page

Create a file: `contents/docs/getting-started/faq/index.mdx`

```mdx
# FAQ

## How do I reset my password?
Go to the login page and click "Forgot Password".

## How do I contact support?
Email us at support@example.com.
```

---

## Need Help?

- For email issues, check your SMTP/app password and logs.
- For Next.js errors, check your terminal and browser console.
- For admin access issues, verify all email references and database updates.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SKS-05/docweb.git
   cd docweb
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

```sql
create table docs (
  email text primary key,
  password text,
  first_login boolean,
  email_sent boolean,
  email_sending boolean,
  message_id text
);
```
- This table is used to store user information, including email, password, login status, and email sending status for the password management feature.

#### B. Gmail Setup for Email Service
1. Create a Gmail account for sending emails
2. Enable 2-factor authentication
3. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Google Account â†’ Security
   - Under "2-Step Verification", click "App passwords"

4. Update `lib/email.ts` with:
   ```typescript
   const adminEmail = 'your_gmail_address';
   const adminPassword = 'your_app_password';
   ```

#### C. Algolia Setup
1. Create an Algolia account
2. Create a new application
3. Create an index for your documentation
4. Configure DocSearch:
   - Submit your site for DocSearch indexing

- `app/login/page.tsx`
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/send-passwords/page.tsx`
- `components/navbar.tsx`

#### C. Update Database Script
Create `scripts/update-admin.js`:
```javascript
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
require('dotenv').config({ path: '.env.local' });

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
);

async function updateAdmin() {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('docs')
    .upsert({
      email: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL,
      password: 'newpassword', // Change this to your desired password
      first_login: false,
      email_sent: true
    });

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error updating admin:', error);
  } else {
    console.log('Admin updated successfully');
  }
}

updateAdmin();
```
