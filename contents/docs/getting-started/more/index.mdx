## Archiving

Throughout Seribro you will find that many databases have an Archived property. This property is used to prevent any entry from being deleted and is instead removed from linked database views using a filter.

## Quick Links

On the top portion of every page, is a Synced Toggle List Block named Quick Links  that is used to access pages frequently used by you. In order to add pages to this section, simple use Notion's Mention feature by using the '@' symbol and typing the name of the page.

<Note>
Synced blocks in Notion are like live copies of content that can be placed on multiple pages. Any changes made to the original block are automatically reflected in all its synced copies, keeping your information consistent across your workspace.

## Fleeting Notes

Below the Quick Links section, on every page, is another Synced Toggle List Block named Fleeting Notes meant to capture unimportant notes. Inside the toggle list is a linked database which shows entries from the Fleeting Notes Database which has only two properties - Name & Created time. A filter is applied on the Linked Database that shows only entries created in the current week.

## Load Limit

Notion improves the performance of databases by using a load limit when the database is being viewed Inline as opposed to the full page view. Across the Seribro workspace the load limit is set to 10 pages. I recommend not changing the limit if you want to prioritize performance. You can always click the 'Load more' option that appears at the bottom of an Inline database when you want to view more entries. Alternately, you can open the database in full page view using the headings above them which are also links to the databases themselves and will open them up in full page view.

# Table of Contents

All sections of Seribro have a heading so that each page can be easily navigated using the Table of Contents feature. You can choose to turn this on or off using the ellipses icon on the top right corner of every page.

# Inline Databases

Even though many templates in Seribro have databases linked to master databases you are always free to create inline databases inside the entry to handle data local to the entry itself. 

# Other

1. Properties in databases do not wrap the column.
2. All databases open pages in Side Peek
3. Page Icons are enabled in all databases everywhere
4. All the feature pages have full width layout

<Note>
Beware of using Last edited time for sorting. Any changes made to an entry will push it to the top immediately.
