# What is Seribro?

Imagine having a personal assistant that organizes every idea, every piece of knowledge, every task, and every goal you've ever come across—accessible anytime, anywhere. That's what Seribro is. It's an external, digital system designed to store, manage, and process the information we gather daily, relieving the burden on our actual brain. With Seribro, you never have to worry about forgetting important details, misplacing insights, or letting ideas slip away.

Think of it as a personalized knowledge hub that grows alongside you. It's a place to capture everything—from fleeting thoughts to deep research, from to-do lists to long-term goals. It connects your past, present, and future, giving you the space to think freely, create more effectively, and make decisions with clarity.

In essence, your Seribro is a faithful companion that keeps you organized, creative, and always on top of things.

# Why is it useful?

In our hyper-connected world, we constantly absorb an overwhelming amount of information. From articles, podcasts, and videos to personal reflections and project notes, we gather knowledge at an unprecedented rate. But here's the thing: **our brains aren't designed to remember it all**. Over time, we lose bits and pieces, and the mental strain of trying to keep everything in our head leads to burnout and stress.

Seribro solves this problem by acting as a storage facility for your thoughts and knowledge. It helps you:

1. **Free up mental space**: Offload your thoughts so your brain can focus on what really matters.
2. **Stay organized**: Keep everything in one place, easily searchable and neatly categorized.
3. **Gain clarity**: Connect ideas, spot patterns, and move forward on projects with purpose.
4. **Boost productivity**: With easy access to all your notes, tasks, and references, you're able to move faster and smarter.
5. **Create more**: Since your mind isn't bogged down with trying to remember everything, you're free to focus on creating and executing ideas.

Seribro is essential for anyone juggling multiple projects, learning continuously, or just wanting to keep their life organized in a way that feels intuitive and stress-free.

# Why use Notion to build it?

Now that you know what Seribro is and why it's so useful, the next question is: why Notion?

# How does Notion work?

Notion is an all-in-one workspace where you can write, plan, collaborate, and organize your life or work. It combines the best features of note-taking apps, task managers, project management tools, and databases into one highly customizable platform. What makes Notion unique is its flexibility: you can mold it to fit almost any workflow, from personal productivity systems like your **Seribro** to company-wide project management systems. Here's a breakdown of how Notion works:

## **1. Pages: The Foundation of Notion**

In Notion, **Pages** are one of the most fundamental building blocks. They function as containers for all types of content—texts, databases, files, embeds, and more. A page can hold nearly anything, making Notion an incredibly versatile tool for organizing information. Here's a deeper look at what **Pages** are and how they work:

### **What are Pages?**

A **Page** in Notion is essentially a blank canvas where you can:

- **Write**: Add text, lists, links, and multimedia content.
- **Organize**: Create databases, tables, boards, or timelines.
- **Embed**: Insert images, videos, PDFs, files, and other external content.
- **Link**: Create references to other pages or databases.
- **Collaborate**: Share and edit pages with others in real time.

Think of each Page as a digital notebook that can grow and evolve over time. Whether you're creating simple to-do lists, complex project management systems, or a personal journal, a Notion page can handle it.

### **How Are Pages Used?**

Pages are used to house **different kinds of content** depending on your needs. Here are some common ways pages are utilized:

1. **Simple Documents**
    
    Pages can be basic documents where you write down notes, ideas, or meeting minutes. They can resemble word processor documents, but with richer functionality like embeds and linking to other pages.
    
2. **Dashboards**
    
    A page can serve as a central hub, pulling together different elements from across your workspace—databases, linked pages, embedded media—into one cohesive dashboard. This is especially useful for **personal productivity systems**, **Seribro setups**, or **project management tools**.
    
3. **Nested Pages (Subpages)**
    
    Pages can be infinitely nested within one another, allowing you to create layers of information. For example, under a project page, you might have subpages for **tasks**, **resources**, and **notes**. This hierarchical structure mirrors a folder system, but it's much more flexible.
    
4. **Database Pages**
    
    Pages can also act as **database entries**. For example, in a tasks database, each task would be a page, where you can track detailed information about that task (due date, assignees, files, etc.). Database pages are highly customizable and support **relations** with other databases to create interconnected workflows.
    
5. **Templates**
    
    Pages can be saved as **templates** for repeated use. If you regularly create similar types of pages, such as project plans or meeting notes, you can build a page template to streamline your workflow.
    
6. **Knowledge Management**
    
    In more complex systems like your Seribro, pages can serve as places to organize information for knowledge management. Pages for **books**, **ideas**, **articles**, or **resources** can be stored and accessed easily, creating a dynamic knowledge base.
    

### **How Pages Function in a Workspace**

Pages aren't limited to static content. They can:

- **Link to databases**: You can create views of databases (like tables or Kanban boards) inside any page.
- **Pull in information from other pages**: With relational databases, information from other pages and databases can be displayed and filtered within a page.
- **Serve as templates**: You can duplicate pages or build template pages for repeated tasks like project planning or daily journaling.

### **The Versatility of Pages**

Pages in Notion are more than just "documents." They are dynamic spaces where you can embed other pages, databases, images, or media, turning each page into a fully customized workspace. Some typical uses of Notion pages include:

- **Personal dashboards**: A daily or weekly overview page pulling in tasks, events, notes, and priorities.
- **Project pages**: A space to manage everything related to a project, from milestones and tasks to meeting notes and documents.

- **Knowledge hubs**: A collection of notes, research, or other key information organized for easy retrieval.

### **Pages vs. Databases**

It's important to note that **pages** and **databases** aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, many pages act as containers for databases. For example, a page titled "Projects" might contain a **Projects Database**, where each project is represented as an individual entry, but also have embedded content like summary text, deadlines, and meeting notes.

### **Why Pages Matter in Notion**

Pages provide flexibility and modularity in how you structure and organize information. You can always adjust a page's content, layout, and connections, allowing you to adapt your workspace as your needs evolve.

If you're customizing your Seribro, understanding how to create, organize, and nest pages is critical to maintaining an organized, efficient, and powerful system for managing your thoughts, tasks, and goals.

## **2. Blocks: The Building Blocks of Everything**

Every element in Notion is a **block**. Whether it's a text, image, to-do list, heading, database, or file, everything you add to a page is considered a block. Blocks are easily movable, so you can drag them around a page to reorganize your content quickly. Simply type a forward slash  / and you'll be able to see and select all the different blocks available in Notion. 

### **Common Blocks:**

- **Text Block**: Simple paragraphs or headings.
- **List Block**: Bullet points, numbered lists, and to-do checklists.
- **Database Block**: You can insert a database directly on any page.
- **File Block**: Upload files or images directly onto a page.

This block-based system makes Notion incredibly versatile because you can mix and match content types however you want.

## **3. Databases: Organizing and Structuring Information**

**Databases** are one of the most powerful features in Notion. A database can take the form of a table, board (like Kanban), calendar, gallery, or list. You can use databases to manage tasks, store notes, track habits, or catalogue anything you like.

Each item in a database is essentially a page that can contain more blocks, including other databases. This makes databases a core part of building complex workflows in Notion, especially for productivity systems like your Seribro.

### **Key Database Features:**

- **Properties**: These are fields that define the attributes of each database entry (e.g., due date, tags, status, priority).
- **Filtering**: You can filter database items based on properties (e.g., show only tasks due this week).
- **Sorting**: Organize database items by any property (e.g., sort tasks by priority or due date).
- **Views**: Display your database in different views (table, calendar, Kanban board, etc.).
- **Relations**: Link databases to each other (e.g., link tasks to projects).
- **Rollups**: Summarize information from related databases (e.g., see how many tasks are linked to a project).

## **4. Views: Tailoring the Display of Information**

Notion allows you to display the same database in multiple ways. For example, you might want to see your tasks as a table when planning and then switch to a calendar view for deadline tracking.

### **Common Database Views:**

- **Table**: A traditional spreadsheet-like view.
- **Board**: A Kanban-style board where items are organized in columns (great for task management).
- **Calendar**: Displays database entries based on date properties, perfect for scheduling and planning.
- **List**: A simple vertical list of items.
- **Gallery**: A visual grid of items, useful for showcasing images or portfolios.

### **5. Linking Information: Relations and Rollups**

One of the most powerful aspects of Notion is its ability to connect different databases using **relations** and **rollups**. This allows you to link related information between different pages or databases.

### **Relations**:

You can create a relation between two databases, allowing items in one database to reference items from another. For example, you could have a **Tasks** database related to a **Projects** database, so each task can be linked to its corresponding project.

### **Rollups**:

After you relate two databases, you can create **rollups**, which pull specific data from one related database into another. For example, you can use a rollup to count how many tasks are linked to a project or to display the due date of the most urgent task within a project.

## **6. Templates: Pre-built Pages and Databases**

Notion allows you to create and save **templates** for commonly used page layouts or database structures. You can use templates to quickly create new projects, meeting notes, or task lists without starting from scratch.

### **Types of Templates:**

- **Page Templates**: Pre-built pages you can duplicate and customize (e.g., weekly planners, journal entries).
- **Database Templates**: Default entries that populate with a certain structure every time you add a new entry (e.g., a project template with fields like start date, goals, tasks).

## **7. Collaboration: Real-Time Teamwork**

Notion is a powerful tool for **collaboration**. You can share pages and databases with team members, assign tasks, and comment on content in real-time. This makes it useful not only for personal productivity but also for team and project collaboration.

### **Collaboration Features:**

- **Sharing**: You can share any page or database with other people and control their access (view, edit, etc.).
- **Comments**: Add comments to any block or page, and mention team members to notify them.
- **Activity History**: Track edits and updates in a page's history, so you can see who made changes.

## **8. Embeds and Integrations**

Notion supports embedding content from other platforms directly into its pages. You can embed Google Drive files, Figma designs, tweets, YouTube videos, and more.

Notion also has integrations with popular tools, though many of its more advanced integrations rely on third-party services like Zapier, Make or Pipedream.

## **9. New Features: Constantly Evolving**

Notion is always introducing new features to expand its capabilities. For example, the recent **Notion Calendar** update allows for better scheduling, and advanced database functionalities are constantly being improved.

### **How Does It All Come Together?**

Ultimately, Notion works as an incredibly **customizable** workspace. Whether you're using it as a simple note-taking tool or building a full-fledged productivity system like Seribro, the modularity of pages, blocks, databases, and views means you can build exactly what you need. Every element in Notion is designed to work together, creating a seamless, interconnected system.

You can start with something simple, like taking notes, and gradually build out more complex systems as your needs evolve—turning it into your ultimate tool for personal or professional productivity.

## Notion Calendar

The **Notion Calendar** is a powerful feature that allows you to manage time, schedule tasks, and view deadlines in a visual, interactive format. With its intuitive design, it can serve as both a standalone calendar and a part of your larger organizational system, whether for personal use, project management, or team collaboration.

### **Key Features of Notion Calendar**

1. **Interactive Scheduling**: You can create, move, and modify tasks directly on the calendar interface. It's perfect for visually managing deadlines, events, and appointments.
2. **Multiple Views**: Switch between **daily**, **weekly**, or **monthly** views to zoom in on your schedule or get a broad overview of upcoming tasks.
3. **Database Integration**: The Notion Calendar is essentially a database view, meaning you can link tasks and projects to it, add properties like priority or tags, and filter or sort them to tailor the view to your needs.
4. **Date Properties**: By adding a date property to any database entry, you can instantly place that item on your calendar, ensuring tasks or events are easy to track.
5. **Relation and Rollup**: Use relational properties to link the calendar to other databases (e.g., Projects, Goals, Tasks) and rollup properties to display additional information directly on your calendar.

### **Time Blocking with Notion Calendar**

A highly effective way to boost productivity using the Notion Calendar is by practicing **time blocking**. Time blocking is a time management technique where you allocate specific blocks of time to different tasks or activities throughout your day. Here's how you can implement this technique using the Notion Calendar:

- **Create Time Blocks**: Use the Notion Calendar to schedule specific tasks or activities by setting them as events with start and end times. Assign different blocks of time for deep work, meetings, breaks, and personal activities.
- **Prioritize Tasks**: In each time block, prioritize tasks that require focus, helping you reduce distractions and maintain momentum. Tasks added to your **Tasks Database** with a due date can automatically show up on your calendar.
- **Review and Adjust**: Notion's drag-and-drop interface allows you to easily move events or tasks on the calendar. If something changes or you need to re-prioritize, simply adjust your time blocks to reflect the new schedule.
- **Link to Projects or Tasks**: Link time blocks to specific tasks or projects in your **Projects** or **Tasks** databases. This helps you stay on top of what's due and focus your time accordingly.

By combining the **Notion Calendar** and **time blocking**, you can gain better control over your day, improve focus, and make steady progress toward your goals. Whether you're planning your workweek or scheduling personal time, Notion's flexibility allows you to create a time management system that works for you.

## Notion Mobile App

Even though you might feel a lot of friction while using Notion app on your mobile, it is still the most convenient way to add entries to your notion databases while on the go. You can either directly use the app and navigate to the page you want or you can add widgets on your phone's home screen.
