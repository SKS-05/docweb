# How does it work?

# Main Features

Your Seribro in Notion revolves around key areas that help you stay organized, focused, and productive. Each Main Page serves a specific purpose, designed to capture and manage different aspects of your life. Let's take a quick tour through each of them:

---

### 1. **Dashboard**

Your Dashboard is the central hub that ties everything together. Think of it as the cockpit for your life, where you can see an overview of your day, tasks, upcoming projects, and more at a glance. It's a bird's-eye view that keeps you grounded and focused, ensuring you never miss a beat.

These Main Features/Pages make up the structure of your Seribro, turning it into a well-organized, personalized system. Each page has a specific purpose, but together they create a cohesive flow that helps you stay on top of every aspect of your life. It's your personal operating system, built for productivity, creativity, and peace of mind.

# Databases

At the heart of your Seribro in Notion is one key element: **Databases**. They are the powerhouse behind how everything connects, stores, and functions seamlessly. Whether it's your tasks, notes, projects, or even recipes, databases enable you to organize and access all your information in a way that suits your workflow.

Databases Page gives you an organized list of all the original databases (or Master Databases) in your Seribro. All the databases that you see in your Main Pages are 'Linked Databases'. A Linked Database in Notion is essentially a view of an existing database that you can embed in a different page. It's not a separate database but a new view of your existing one, allowing you to access and display the same set of data from multiple pages. 

<Note>

Make sure not to delete any of the Master Databases in the Databases Page as this would lead to loss of functionality. One neat trick you can do to prevent accidental changes is to lock the Databases Page. You can do this by clicking on the Ellipsis icon (3 dots) on the top right corner of the Databases Page and toggling 'Lock Page' to ON.  

</Note>

Databases in Notion are highly flexible, acting as dynamic storage systems that can be displayed in multiple views (lists, tables, Kanban boards, galleries, etc.). Once you understand how to use them effectively, you'll see how powerful your Seribro can become. They keep your life **interconnected**—tasks linking to projects, notes linking to goals, everything flowing together harmoniously.

<Note>

If you're unfamiliar with Notion Databases, you can read the 'Databases Features' section and by clicking the Chevron( ▶ Arrow head or Play icon to the left of the heading).

</Note>

All database entries can be archived when **inactive or completed** and can be found in the **Archive View.** This is where you put past projects, reference materials you no longer need, or old tasks that are no longer relevant. Archives keep your workspace clutter-free without losing valuable information or ever needing to delete items.

## Relations between Databases

Relations between Databases are created using the 'Relation' Property and data from related databases can be looked up using the 'Rollup' Property.

### Areas

The Areas Database generally doesn't hold any content but is rather used as a means of categorization for other 'Core' Databases. It is linked to the Notes Master Database, Tasks Master Database and the Habits Master Database in a two-way relationship.

It is a 'Recursive Database' which means that entries in the database can be related to other entries in the same database, creating a hierarchical or cyclical structure. This allows Areas to have a Parent-Child relationship i.e. some Areas can have a 'Root Area' ex: Workouts can have a Root Area of Health. This also allows to organize Notes and Task under same Root Area using templates and Rollup Property of databases in Notion.

Notes, Web Clips, Tasks, Projects or Goals that have a parent from the same database can also have a 'Parent Area' which is of course the area of that the parent is related to.

### Notes and Web Clips

Notes and Web Clips features are part of the same Notes Master Database. The only difference is that Notes where the URL property is entered as considered as Web Clips.

Notes and Web Clips are related to the Tasks Master Database and can be associated with any Task, Project or Goal. It is also related to the Areas Database.

Notes Master Database is also a 'Recursive Database', so a Note can have a Parent Note. 

Notes that are related to Tasks can also be viewed under the Project/Goal that is a parent of those Tasks through the use of Rollup Property called 'Root Tasks'.

### Tasks, Projects and Goals

Tasks, Projects and Goals belong to the same Tasks Master Database which is also a Recursive Database. This allows Projects to have Tasks as Child entries under them and Goals to have Projects as Child entries under them. Not only that, Tasks can have Sub-tasks, Projects can have Sub-projects and Goals can have Sub-goals under them. 

Tasks that are related to a Project can also be viewed under the Goal that is a parent of that Project through the 'Root Task' Rollup Property.

The Task Master Database is related to the Areas Master Database and Habits Master Database.

### Habits

Habits have a separate database called Habits Master Database for the sake of simplicity. The database also uses a 3rd party integration to create entries in a Google Sheet which is used to generate a Streak-based progress graph of the habit which can be embed back into Notion. Habits however can be linked to the Tasks database so that they can be considered as part of a Goal.

### Wins

Wins are related to Goals i.e., the Tasks Master Database and through the Rollup Property they also are linked to an Area.

---

The other databases aren't linked to the above mentioned Core Feature Databases 

### Finance

The Finance feature uses 4 Databases to function - Transaction Master Database, Budgets Master Database, Categories, and Account. Both the Transaction Master Database and Budgets Master Database are related to the Categories and Accounts Databases. 

The Transaction and Budgets Master Databases use a 3rd party integration to write data on to Google Spreadsheet, which is then used to Analyze spending and create visualizations that can be embedded back in the Finance Page.

### Investments & Debts

Investments feature uses the Investments Master Database and Investment Types Database which are related to each other.

Debts feature uses Debt Master Database and Debt Repayments Database which are related to each other.

### Travel

Travel Master Database is a Recursive Database used to link 3 location types - Site, City and Country. It is also related to separate tasks, notes and expenses database called Travel Tasks, Travel Notes and Travel Expenses. This is done for the sake of simplicity.

### Books & Recipes

Both use a single master database with no relations to any other database.
