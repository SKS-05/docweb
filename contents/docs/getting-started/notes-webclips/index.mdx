# Notes & Web Clips

# Notes Master Database

## Overview

The Notes Master Database is a core component of Seribro, designed to capture and organize various types of information including notes, checklists, resource pools, web clips, and other content types. This database serves as a comprehensive knowledge management system, allowing users to store, categorize, and retrieve information efficiently.

## Key Features

### 1. Processing and Review Features

- The Processed checkbox ensures that notes and web clips remain in the user's view until they have been properly dealt with. This feature helps maintain an organized workflow by keeping unprocessed information front and center.
- The Check Later feature lets users flag notes for future review, ensuring important information isn't overlooked.
- Favoriting enables users to quickly access their most important or frequently used notes, streamlining information retrieval.

### 2. Web Clips Integration

Notes with a populated URL property are considered Web Clips, allowing for easy saving and organization of online content.

### 3. Hierarchical Organization

The recursive nature of the database (Child Note and Parent Note properties) allows for nested note structures, called Resources. Consider them as collections or resource pool of notes.

### 4. Task Integration

Notes can be associated with tasks, projects, or goals through the Task and Pulling Task relations, facilitating action-oriented note-taking. The Root Task rollup provides a clear view of the highest-level task associated with each note.

### 5. Area Categorization

The Area relation, along with the Root Area and Parent Area rollups, allows for comprehensive categorization of notes, making it easier to group related information and understand its place in the broader knowledge structure.

### 6. Cross-Database Visibility

Rollup properties ensure that notes appear in relevant Task and Area pages, and also templates, creating a seamless connection between information and its context or related action items.

### 7. Archiving System

The Archived property enables users to declutter their active notes without permanently deleting information.

## Database Schema

The Notes Master Database includes the following properties:

### 1. Name (Title Property)

This is the primary identifier for each note entry.

### 2. Type (Select Property)

Categorizes the note into different types. Options include:

- Plain : For simple or uncategorizable notes
- Checklist : For numbered or bulleted lists like Shopping lists.
- Journal : For daily journaling.
- Resource : For a collection or resource pool of notes using the Parent-Child relation.
- Idea : For strokes of brilliance.
- Insight : For new pieces to the puzzles.
- Epiphany : For rediscovering meanings of things hidden in plain sight.
- Work : All work related notes. Maybe a new business idea.
- Lecture : For note taking during a one-way communication session or broadcast.
- Meeting : Note taking during two-way communication or discussion.
- Voice : For note taking when typing is too cumbersome .
- Video : When even a thousand pictures aren't enough.
- Image : When a thousand words aren't enough.
- Quote : When the way something was said is just right.

<Note>
You can add more types or delete existing ones to customize your Seribro. You can also change the property type from 'Select' to 'Multi-select' which will allow you to tag a note with multiple types.

### 3. URL (URL Property)

Stores the source URL for web clips or online resources. Entering a URL in this field turns any note into a web clip and it'll show up in the Web Clips page.

### 4. Domain Name (Formula Property)

A formula is used to determine the domain name of a web clip URL for grouping in some views of the Web Clips page. 

Following is the Notion formula for this property:

```jsx
replace(
    prop("URL"), /* Get the URL property */

    /* 'Regular expression' to match and capture the domain name */
    "([^/]*//)?(www\\.)?([^/]*).*", 
    /* 
        - ([^/]*//)? matches the protocol (http:// or https://) if present
        - (www\\.)? matches "www." if present
        - ([^/]*) captures the domain name
        - .* matches the rest of the URL
    */
    
    "$3" /* Replace the entire URL with the captured domain name */
)
```

### 5. Processed (Checkbox Property)

Indicates whether the note has been reviewed or acted upon. When unchecked notes and web clips remain in their Inbox view on their respective pages. Make sure to assign Type, Area and/or Task before checking off this property.

### 20. Edited (Formula Property)

A formula property used to show the time passed since the note or web clip was last edited in a neat way. It is calculated using the Last edited time property mentioned above. 

Following is the Notion formula of this property:

```jsx
let(
    lastEdited, prop("Last edited time"), /* Store the last edited time property in a variable */
    
    let(
        now, now(), /* Get the current time */
        
        let(

                        let(
                            daysRemaining, dateBetween(dateSubtract(now, months, "months"), lastEdited, "days"), /* Calculate remaining days after full months */
                                
                            if(
                                dateBetween(now, lastEdited, "years") < 1, /* Check if less than a year */
                                
                                if(
                                    dateBetween(now, lastEdited, "months") < 1, /* Check if less than a month */
                                    format(days) + "d", /* Output days */
                                    
                                    format(months) + "m, " + format(daysRemaining) + "d" /* Output months and remaining days */
                                ),
                                
                                format(years) + "y, " + format(monthsRemaining) + "m, " + format(daysRemaining) + "d" /* Output years, remaining months, and days */
                            )

                let(
                    days, dateBetween(now, created, "days"), /* Calculate the difference in days */
                    
                    let(
                        monthsRemaining, dateBetween(dateSubtract(now, years, "years"), created, "months"), /* Calculate remaining months after full years */

                            if(
                                dateBetween(now, created, "years") < 1, /* Check if less than a year */
                                
                                if(
                                    dateBetween(now, created, "months") < 1, /* Check if less than a month */
                                    format(days) + "d", /* Output days */
                                    
                                    format(months) + "m, " + format(daysRemaining) + "d" /* Output months and remaining days */
                                ),
                                
                                format(years) + "y, " + format(monthsRemaining) + "m, " + format(daysRemaining) + "d" /* Output years, remaining months, and days */
                            )
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
).style("c","b","green","green_background") /* Apply styles to the output */

```

## Database Views

The database includes several pre-configured views:

1. All Notes: Shows all active notes.
2. Archived Notes: Shows all notes marked as archived.
3. All Web Clips: Shows all active web clips.
4. Archived Web Clips:  Shows all archived web clips.

## Best Practices

- Use the Type property consistently to categorize notes effectively.
- Leverage the hierarchical structure (Child/Parent Note) for complex topics or projects.
- Regularly review and process notes using the Check Later and Processed properties.
- Utilize the Archived property instead of deleting notes to maintain a comprehensive knowledge base.
- Take advantage of the Task relations and Root Task rollup to create an actionable note-taking system.
- Use the Area relation to create a multi-level organizational structure for your notes.

The Notes Master Database serves as a versatile and powerful tool for capturing, organizing, and retrieving information within the Seribro system. Its integration with other databases, flexible property structure, and intelligent use of rollup properties allows for a highly customizable and effective knowledge management solution that can adapt to complex information hierarchies and task relationships.

# Notes Database Templates

## Details Side Panel

For every Note Database Template, all note properties are located in the Details Side Panel that can be accessed by clicking the Panel button on the top right corner of the page ("view details" alt text)  or clicking the 'View details' button below the title of the page. The Area property and Files & Media property appears separately for quick access.

## Note Template

This is the default template for any type of note. Since Notion was initially built as a documentation tool, it has good text editing features. So you can simply start typing irrespective of the type of note. However, you can create your own custom templates if you prefer it. 

## Resource Template

This template is created for notes that behave as a collection of other notes and web clips also called Resources. It has a callout block for context and a linked database. The details of the linked database are as follows

### Linked Notes & Web Clips

# Web Clips Page

### Overview

The Web Clips page serves as a central hub for managing web clippings and related notes within the Notes Master Database.

<Note>
One of the best way to save web clips from the internet while on your desktop is to use the browser extension 'Flylighter'. 

---

 It currently supports Chromium-based web browsers and any other browser that supports Chrome extensions. Firefox and Safari support are planned as future releases.

Its not the official Notion extension which is named 'Notion Web Clipper', although you can use that if you like it. We recommend Flylighter for its ability to create custom workflows for particular notion databases, customize properties when saving the clipping, being able to save or even append highlights and save content from the web page which shows up as content inside the Web Clip. It can even take note of timestamps on YouTube videos. 

Here's the Web Store link to Flylighter:
