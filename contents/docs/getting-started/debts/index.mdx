## Database Schema

The Debts Master Database includes the following properties:

### 1. Name (Title Property)

This is the primary identifier for each debt entry. It should contain a brief, descriptive title of the debt or loan.

### 2. Loan Amount (Number Property)

Represents the total amount of the loan or debt. This property is formatted in US dollars.

### 3. Interest per Annum (Number Property)

```

### 15. Expected Debt Duration (Formula Property)

Calculates the time it will take to repay the debt in years & months based on the standard details provided. The Notion formula is as follows:

```jsx
let(

    /* Declares `duration` to calculate the total loan duration in months. */
    -log10(1 - prop("Interest per Month") * (prop("Loan Amount") - prop("Down Payment")) / prop("Minimum Repayment")) / log10(1 + prop("Interest per Month")),
    /* Uses a formula to calculate the loan duration based on interest rate, loan amount, down payment, and minimum repayment. */

    let(
        quo, 
        floor(divide(duration, 12)), 
        /* Calculates the whole years by dividing the duration by 12 and taking the floor. */

        let(
            rem,   
            ceil(mod(duration, 12)),
            /* Calculates the remaining months by taking the modulus of duration divided by 12. */

            if(
                duration > 12,
                quo + "y " + rem + "m", 
                /* If duration is more than 12 months, formats the result as "Xy Ym" (years and months). */

                if(duration > 0, rem + "m", "") 
                /* If duration is less than 12 months, shows only the months. Returns an empty string if duration is 0. */
            )
        )
    )
)

```

### 16. Expected Debt Free Data (Formula Property)

Based on the loan details, this property calculates the Date on which you are expected to be debt free.

The Notion formula is as follows:

```jsx
let(
    days, 
    /* Declares `days` to calculate the total loan duration in days. */

    -log10(1 - prop("Interest per Month") * (prop("Loan Amount") - prop("Down Payment")) / prop("Minimum Repayment")) * 30.436875 / log10(1 + prop("Interest per Month")),
    /* Calculates the loan duration in days using interest rate, loan amount, down payment, and minimum repayment. 
       Multiplies by 30.436875 (average days in a month) to convert months into days. */

    dateAdd(
        prop("Initial Repayment Date"), 
        round(days),
