# Areas Master Database Documentation

## Overview

The Areas Master Database is a core component of Seribro, designed to organize and categorize all notes, web clips, tasks, projects, goals and habits. This database serves as a comprehensive structure for managing different aspects of life, work, or any other categorization needed.

## Key Features

### Integration with Other Databases

The Areas Master Database is closely integrated with other core databases in the Kriyatus system:

- Tasks Master Database: Through the Tasks and Pulling Task relations, connecting areas to specific tasks and actions.
- Habits Database: Via the Habits relation, linking areas to relevant habits or routines.
- Notes Master Database: Through the Notes relation, connecting areas to relevant information and documentation.

### Hierarchical Structure

The database supports a hierarchical structure through the Root Area and Sub Area relations. This allows for the creation of complex organizational structures with main areas, sub-areas, and even further nested levels of categorization.

## Database Schema

The Areas Master Database includes the following properties:

### 1. Name (Title Property)

This is the primary identifier for each area entry. It represents the name or title of the area, project, or topic.

### 2. Maslow's Hierarchy (Select Property)

This property categorizes the area according to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Options include:

- Transcendence needs
- Self-actualization
- Aesthetic needs
- Cognitive needs
- Esteem needs
- Love and Social needs
- Safety needs
- Physiological needs

ðŸ’¡

Nearly every area or category of your life has a place in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs based on what you get out of the activity.  We recommend this categorization because it help you understand your goals more clearly. 

If you haven't come across Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs before, we strongly recommend that you read about it. Try this Wikipedia entry:

### 3. Processed (Checkbox Property)

Indicates whether the entry has been reviewed or acted upon. When unchecked new Areas remain in the Inbox view. Make sure to assign all relevant properties before checking off this property. 

### 4. Favourites (Checkbox Property)

Allows users to mark important or frequently accessed areas.

### 5. Archived (Checkbox Property)

Used to remove areas from active view without deletion.

### 6. Root Area (Relation Property)

Links the current area to a parent or higher-level area within the same database. This is a many-to-one relation, allowing for hierarchical organization of areas.

### 7. Sub Area (Relation Property)

The inverse of Root Area, showing which areas are nested under the current one. This is a one-to-many relation, allowing multiple sub-areas to be associated with a root area.

### 8. Notes (Relation Property)

Links the area to related notes in the Notes Master Database. This is a one-to-many relation, allowing multiple notes to be associated with an area. The synced property name in the Notes Master database is "Area".

### 9. Tasks (Relation Property)

Links the area to related tasks in the Tasks Master Database. This is a one-to-many relation, allowing multiple tasks to be associated with an area. The synced property name in the Tasks Master database is "Area".

### 10. Habits (Relation Property)

Connects the area to related habits in the Habits Database. This is a one-to-many relation, allowing multiple habits to be associated with an area. The synced property name in the Habits Master database is "Area".

### 11. Last edited time (Last Edited Time Property)

Automatically updates when the area entry is modified.

### 12. Edited (Formula Property)

A formula property used to show the time passed since the Area was last edited in a neat way. It is calculated using the Last edited time property mentioned above. So do not delete that property. If you change its name, you will have to change it in the formula as well if you want this property to work. 

Following is the Notion formula of this property:

```jsx
let(
    lastEdited, prop("Last edited time"), /* Store the last edited time property in a variable */
    
    let(
        now, now(), /* Get the current time */
        
        let(
            years, dateBetween(now, lastEdited, "years"), /* Calculate the difference in years */
            
            let(
                months, dateBetween(now, lastEdited, "months"), /* Calculate the difference in months */
                
                let(
                    days, dateBetween(now, lastEdited, "days"), /* Calculate the difference in days */
                    
                    let(
                        monthsRemaining, dateBetween(dateSubtract(now, years, "years"), lastEdited, "months"), /* Calculate remaining months after full years */
                        
                        let(
                            daysRemaining, dateBetween(dateSubtract(now, months, "months"), lastEdited, "days"), /* Calculate remaining days after full months */
                                
                            if(
                                dateBetween(now, lastEdited, "years") < 1, /* Check if less than a year */
                                
                                if(
                                    dateBetween(now, lastEdited, "months") < 1, /* Check if less than a month */
                                    format(days) + "d", /* Output days */
                                    
                                    format(months) + "m, " + format(daysRemaining) + "d" /* Output months and remaining days */
                                ),
                                
                                format(years) + "y, " + format(monthsRemaining) + "m, " + format(daysRemaining) + "d" /* Output years, remaining months, and days */
                            )
                        )
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
).style("c","b","blue","blue_background") /* Apply styles to the output */
```

### 13. Date Created (Created Time Property)

Automatically records when the area entry was created.

## 14. Files & Media

Allows adding files as attachment to any entry. For a free account, the upload size is limited to 5MB.

## Database Views

The Areas Master Database includes two pre-configured views:

1. All Areas: This view likely displays all active (non-archived) areas in the database. 
2. Archived Areas: This view shows archived areas.

## Best Practices

- Use the Maslow's Hierarchy property to align areas with personal development goals.
- Utilize the Favourites property to quickly access frequently used or important areas.
- Regularly review and update the hierarchical structure using Root Area and Sub Area relations to maintain an organized system.
- Use the Archived property to keep the active views clutter-free without losing historical data.
- Periodically review Last edited time to identify areas that may need attention or updating.

# Area Template

## Overview

The Area Template acts as the default template for areas in the area master database. It has a predefined structure that utilizes the full potential of all the relation properties associated with an area.

## Template Structure

### Details Panel

All area properties are located in the Details Side Panel that can be accessed by clicking the Panel button on the top right corner of the page ("view details" alt text)  or clicking the 'View details' button below the title of the page. The Files and Media property appears separately for quick access.

### New Entry Buttons

Five buttons - New Note, New Task, New Project, New Goal and New Sub Area when clicked will create entries in relevant databases and show up in the linked databases within this template. They will be automatically linked to the current area using relevant relation properties.

### Callout Block

This section can be used to give a quick description of the task.
